👩‍💻 Ruthi Edel | Data Science


I'm currently focused on advanced **NLP research**, especially around **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, query type classification, and optimizing hybrid search strategies.  
My work combines hands-on development with deep research — from building pipelines with MLflow and Prefect to experimenting with query rewriting and context evaluation using LLMs.

You'll also find older but valuable projects here from my time learning web development, full-stack applications, and practical AI integrations.

## 🔬 Current Interests

-NLP missions
- Analyzing how query types affect RAG
- Optimizing RAG pipelines by rewriting queries based on intent
- Managing isolated ML experiments using MLflow & Prefect
- Generating questions for RAG data synthetic 
- Designing modular RouteChain-based logic for controlled prompting

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** **Python** , TypeScript , Node.js , C#   
- **AI & NLP:** OCR, LMM(T5, OpenAI,etc) ,Transformers , BERT , Embedding
- **Pipelines:** MLflow, Prefect  
- **DevOps:** Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes 
- **Cloud & APIs:** Azure, SharePoint (Graph API), MongoDB, SQL Server  
- **Web Dev (Legacy Projects):** Next.js, React, **FastAPI**
